# 🚀 Coding Buddy: AI-Powered Learning Editor

**Coding Buddy** is a modern, web-based code development environment built with **React** and **Vite**. It bridges the gap between writing code and understanding it. By combining a real-time multi-language compiler with a pedagogically-focused AI, it helps developers not just run code, but master it.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Learning-First AI**: Our AI acts as a mentor rather than a shortcut. It breaks down logic, explains "why" things work, and guides you through the learning process without just dumping direct code snippets.
* **Multi-Language Compiler**: Powered by the **Piston API**, supporting 50+ languages (C++, Python, JS, Java, etc.) with full `stdin` input support for interactive programs.
* **Professional Editor**: Integrated with the **Monaco Editor** (the engine behind VS Code) for professional syntax highlighting and auto-completion.
* **Smart Persistence**: Your work is automatically synced to `localStorage`, ensuring your progress is safe even if you refresh your browser.

## 🧠 The AI Philosophy: "Learn, Don't Just Copy"

The "Explain" feature in Coding Buddy is designed specifically for students and curious developers. When you ask for help, the AI:
1.  **Identifies the Pattern**: It recognizes the algorithm or data structure you are attempting.
2.  **Explains the Logic**: It walks through your code step-by-step to clarify the control flow.
3.  **Encourages Growth**: It suggests mental models and improvements rather than just providing a "copy-paste" solution.
